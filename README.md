# Custom-Color-Themes
This repo contains custom color themes that I have made for Visual Studio. Specifically, this repo contians the Dark Green Theme I made. I may add others if time permits...

The theme was created using the [Theme Editor For Visual Studio 2019](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioPlatformTeam.VisualStudio2019ColorThemeEditor).

The actual project files were created using the [VS2019 Color Theme Designer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-madsk.ColorThemeDesigner&ssr=false#overview).

### This theme does not currently work with Visual Studio 2026 Insiders. It may be updated in the future to support that version.
