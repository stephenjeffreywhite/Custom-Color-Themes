This theme comes in three verions:

1. Visual Studio 2026
2. Visual Studio 2022
3. Visual Studio 2019


### 1️⃣ Visual Studio 2026 Version

This theme was created manually with AI Assistance Chat GPT 5.2. It features minimal green accent colors, simialr to the default dark and purple theme that Visual Studio 2026 uses.

Some guidance was also taken by using [🔗 examples provided by Mads Kristensen here](https://github.com/madskristensen/BlueSteel).


### 2️⃣ Visual Studio 2019 and 2022 Version
The theme was created using the [Theme Editor For Visual Studio 2019](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioPlatformTeam.VisualStudio2019ColorThemeEditor).

The actual project files were created using the [VS2019 Color Theme Designer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-madsk.ColorThemeDesigner&ssr=false#overview).

**This version of theme is not compatible with Visual Studio 2026**
